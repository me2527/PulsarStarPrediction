# PulsarStarPrediction
Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. The classification algorithms, in particular, are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate datasets as binary classification problems (predict either 0 or 1). Here, the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class (less in numbers), and the remaining examples are a majority negative class.
